                                             Insider Threat Detection Using User Behavior Analytics (UBA) 



This project is a backend system built using Python where the `app.py` file acts as the central brain that loads the `enhanced_data.csv` dataset, performs preprocessing such as cleaning, filtering, and feature extraction, and then exposes endpoints through which the frontend can interact, making it possible to send requests and receive results in JSON format; the dataset located in the `data/` folder represents enhanced information that can be used for tasks like anomaly detection, predictive modeling, or general analysis, and the `requirements.txt` ensures that all dependencies such as Flask (or FastAPI), pandas, scikit-learn, and numpy are installed consistently across environments, thereby allowing smooth execution; the flow of the project begins with the frontend sending a request, which is received by the backend server (`app.py`), then the server processes the input, fetches or manipulates the dataset as required, possibly applies an ML model such as Isolation Forest or Autoencoder for anomaly detection, and finally returns the processed result or prediction back to the frontend in a structured response that can be visualized in dashboards, graphs, or alerts; this single-direction data pipeline — from frontend → backend → dataset/model → backend → frontend — makes the architecture modular and scalable, where the backend acts as the mediator between user interaction and machine intelligence, ensuring that every request is handled efficiently and securely; in addition, this project demonstrates the integration of machine learning with a lightweight backend service, making it suitable for hackathons, prototype development, or production deployment, and it highlights how real-world datasets can be connected with APIs to deliver intelligent services seamlessly, thereby offering a practical foundation for further extension into advanced analytics, visualization, and anomaly detection systems.
