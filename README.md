About
This repository integrates a frontend built with React for alert visualization, user profiling, and timeline monitoring, along with Python-based anomaly detection algorithms. It is suitable for research, prototyping, or building insider threat detection dashboards.

Features
Alert and user profile dashboards (React)

Interactive timeline visualization (React)

Jupyter notebooks for machine learning and RL-based anomaly detection (Python)

Deep learning model using autoencoders (Python)

CSV data for analytics and experiments

Streamable anomaly ZIP for sharing and storage

Setup & Installation
Frontend (React)

Ensure Node.js and npm/yarn are installed.

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

text
git clone <repo-url>
cd <project-folder>
npm install
npm run start
Backend/Notebooks (Python)

Install Python >= 3.7 and Jupyter Notebook.

Navigate to the notebook folder and launch your preferred notebook.

Other Files

Unzip AnomalyStream.zip for additional resources.

Usage
Run the React frontend to explore data visualizations and dashboards.

Use Jupyter notebooks for machine learning analysis and training with enhanced data (enhanced data.csv).

Python scripts and notebooks support anomaly detection using RL and autoencoders.
